			<h1>Breakout sessions</h1>

			<p>After the popularity of the breakout sessions at Edgeconf you can now take part in the following events at the Mozilla London offices to carry on the conversation.</p>

			<p>Scheduled dates are: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Weds Sept 30th</li>
				<li>Tues Oct 27th</li>
				<li>Weds Nov 25th</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/breakout-sessions-tickets-18287632802">Sign up to the September event</a> </strong></p>

			<p>Sessions consist of an hour long group discussion amongst attendees centring around an area of web development. A facilitator will introduce the topic and gather the agenda at the start of the session.</p>

			<p>Attendees are encouraged to submit agenda points, to give structure to the conversation, prior to the event to reduce the time spent in the session setting the agenda.</p>

			<p>You can submit suggestions for discussions topics and agenda points in <a href="https://github.com/mairead/breakout-sessions/issues">the Github issues</a>
			</p>

			<p>Attendees are also encouraged to work towards a resolution or consider how the discussion could inform future action. This could take the form of a blog article, a request for new standards or further discussion.</p>

			<p>In September we will be discussing Progressive apps.
